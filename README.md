# PCA-SVM-Evaluation-Metrics
Implementation of SVM &amp; PCA using eigen decomposition on sample data sets

Q1. Data and other details are available at 

https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html

Use the weblink and reproduce the result for SVM.

1. Implemented SVM to classify the type of iris flower based on its sepal length and width using the iris dataset.
2. Used the scikit-learn digits dataset and an SVM to classify handwritten digits? 
For both datasets, provided a step-by-step code, including:  

Loading the dataset 
Visualizing the data 
Splitting the data into training and testing sets 
Initializing and training the SVM model 
Testing the model 
Additionally, without using libraries (implemented from scratch)

->Used Precision, Recall, F-1 Score, and accuracy on test data to evaluate the performance of the SVM model.
->Plotted confusion matrix for test data.

Q2. Principal Component Analysis:

To do PCA, use the Eigen decomposition available in numpy. The dataset can be obtained from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_pca_3d.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-decomposition-plot-pca-3d-py.
